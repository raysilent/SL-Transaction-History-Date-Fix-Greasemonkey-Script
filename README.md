Second Life L$ Transaction History Date Fix From Local To SLT



That was a script to fix temporary bug in Second Life L$ Transaction History which was showing Local browser time in transactions instead of SLT time which most were used to.
The bug is now fixed, so I'm only keeping this here for history.
